Are follow up questions needed here:
Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (663 > 512). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForQuestionAnswering: ['vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForQuestionAnswering from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForQuestionAnswering were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['qa_outputs.bias', 'qa_outputs.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
